so to start with; it forces me to move both generators
technically I could only move the chip but than the next move is either move 1 or 2 chips down (since they can't go up to floor 3)
So when both generators are moved, it forces me to move up again. Because I can't move a single item down to floor 1 without frying a chip.

Move 1

1|Tg-Tm                           |

from here the options are thin as well. 
Either keep moving the generators, or move a pair - both up since down is nonsensical
it makes more sense to move a pair as just 2 microchips on a floor seems a hindrance
Put another way, to now move Pm & Sm I have to use another microchip, and moreover I have to use 
at least a generator (or a pair) down at floor 1 in order to pick up Tg-Tm pair
So long story short; move 2 is moving a pair from floor 2 to floor 3

Move 2

2|      Pg-Pm                     |
1|Tg-Tm                           |

so then the next 2 moves; it doesn't matter if I move a pair, or 2 microchips because something needs to be taken back down
again which ends up undoing whatever is was I moved, i.e. the state after 2 moves is the same regardless
What is significant after move 4 is that there's a single generator to move around with.
Also at this point is the option to move another 2 microchips up to floor 4.
However, having 2 single microchips on the upper floor is not advantageous because when moving 2 generators up there
something has to be brought back down and the only option than is to take a microchip on condition floor 3 only has microchips.
